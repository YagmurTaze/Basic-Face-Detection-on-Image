# Face Detection on Images

## Overview
This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. The goal is to detect faces in images and highlight them with rectangles.

## Requirements
- OpenCV
- C++ Compiler
- Haar Cascade XML file (included in the Resources folder)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YagmurTaze/Basic-Face-Detection-on-Image.git

## Sample Results

Here are some sample results of the face detection project:

![Result 1](results/face1.png)

![Result 2](results/face2.png)

![Result 3](results/scale-1.05.png)

Last one is very slow because of the scale
